# Building My Personal Website: A Journey in Next.js and TypeScript

Creating a personal website is both exciting and daunting. It's your digital home on the internet, a place to showcase your work, share your thoughts, and connect with others. Here's how I approached building mine using modern web technologies.

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js for several compelling reasons:

### Performance Out of the Box

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for better initial load times
- Automatic code splitting for optimized bundles
- Built-in image optimization
- Static site generation (SSG) capabilities

### Developer Experience

- Hot reloading for instant feedback
- TypeScript support out of the box
- File-based routing system
- API routes for backend functionality

### SEO Benefits

- Better search engine indexing with SSR
- Automatic meta tag optimization
- Dynamic sitemaps and robots.txt

## Tech Stack Choices

Here's what I'm using to build this site:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **Content**: MDX for blog posts (combining Markdown with React components)
- **Deployment**: Vercel for seamless CI/CD

## Key Features I'm Implementing

### 1. Blog with MDX

Using MDX allows me to:

- Write content in Markdown
- Embed React components when needed
- Maintain consistent styling
- Keep content separate from presentation logic

### 2. Project Showcase

A dedicated section to highlight my UX design work and development projects, including:

- Case studies with detailed walkthroughs
- Interactive prototypes
- Code samples and explanations

### 3. Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach ensuring the site works beautifully on all devices.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Content Management

**Problem**: How to manage blog posts efficiently without a CMS.
**Solution**: Using MDX files with frontmatter for metadata, processed at build time.

### Challenge: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Ensuring fast load times while maintaining rich content.
**Solution**: Leveraging Next.js built-in optimizations and careful bundle analysis.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add several features in the coming weeks:

- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Search functionality for blog posts
- [ ] Newsletter signup
- [ ] Comments system
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## Lessons Learned

Building a personal website is more than just codingâ€”it's about:

1. **Defining your personal brand**: What message do you want to convey?
2. **Understanding your audience**: Who are you building this for?
3. **Balancing perfection with progress**: Ship early, iterate often
4. **Documenting the journey**: Share your process and learnings

## Conclusion

This project has been a great opportunity to experiment with new technologies while creating something meaningful for my professional presence. The combination of Next.js and TypeScript provides a solid foundation that's both powerful and maintainable.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to enhance and evolve this site!
